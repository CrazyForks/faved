## Requirements

- Docker

## Installation
### Installation with Docker (fastest way to run locally)
#### 1. Pull the latest stable image from Docker Hub

```bash
docker pull denho/faved
```

#### 2. Start the Docker container
```bash
docker run -d --name faved -p 8080:80 -v faved-data:/var/www/html/storage denho/faved
```
This command will:
* Run the container in the background (`-d`).
* Name the container `faved` (`--name faved`).
* Map port `8080` on your host to port `80` inside the container (`-p 8080:80`). You can change `8080` to any port you prefer.
* Create and mount a named volume called faved-data to application storage directory inside the container (`-v faved-data:/var/www/html/storage`).

#### 3. Access the application
Once the container is running, you can access the Faved application in your web browser at http://localhost:8080. 

The first time you visit, you'll be prompted to set up the database. Just click "Create Database" to proceed and finish the installation.

### Installation using Docker Compose (recommended for server deployment)
#### 1. Create a new directory for your Faved installation
```bash
mkdir faved-app
cd faved-app
```
#### 2. Copy the `docker-compose.yml` [file from this repository](/docker-compose.yml) to your new directory
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denho/faved/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
 ```
#### 3. Change the application default ports (optional)

By default, the application will run on port `8080`. When you are installing on a server, you probably want to use port 80.

If you want to change the default port, create an `.env` file with the corresponding environmental variables, like this (change the port to the desired one):
```bash
echo 'PORT=80' >> .env
```
If you are planning to use your own domain with an SSL, also add the following variable:
```bash
SSL_PORT=443
```
#### 3. Start the Docker service 
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
#### 4. Enable SSL for your domain (optional)
If you are planning to use your own domain with an SSL, run the following command to install a Let\'s Encrypt certificate (replace `yourdomain.com` with your domain name):
```bash
docker exec -it faved-web-app sh -c "certbot --apache -d yourdomain.com"
```
#### 5. Access the application

Once the container is running, you can access the Faved application in your web browser under the local or remote address and the port you've set up. 

Typically, the URL will be: 
- http://localhost:8080 for a local installation (if you changed the default port number, replace `8080` with the port you've set)
- https://example.com for a server installation with a domain and SSL enabled
- http://206.189.108.11 for a server installation without a domain (replace `206.189.108.11` with your actual server IP address) 

The first time you visit, you'll be prompted to set up the database. Just click "Create Database" to proceed and finish the installation.

## Updating

### Updating with Docker

#### 1. Pull the latest stable image from Docker Hub

```bash
docker pull denho/faved
```

#### 2. Stop and remove the running container
```bash
docker stop faved
docker rm faved
```
If you changed the container name during installation, replace `faved` with the name you used.

#### Start a new Docker container
```bash
docker run -d --name faved -p 8080:80 -v faved-data:/var/www/html/storage denho/faved
```

### Updating using Docker Compose
#### 1. Pull the latest `docker-compose.yml` [file from this repository](/docker-compose.yml) to your directory with the application
```bash
cd faved-app
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denho/faved/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
 ```

#### 2. Recreate the Docker service with the latest image pulled from Docker Hub
```bash
docker compose up --pull always -d
```
