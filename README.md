## Requirements

- Docker

## Installation
1. Pull the latest stable image from Docker Hub.
```
docker pull denho/faved
```

2. Start the Docker container:
```bash
docker run -d --name faved -p 8080:80 -v faved-data:/var/www/html/storage denho/faved
```
This command will:
* Run the container in the background (-d).
* Name the container faved (--name faved).
* Map port 8080 on your host to port 80 inside the container (-p 8080:80). You can change 8080 to any port you prefer.
* Create and mount a named volume called faved-data to application storage directory inside the container (-v faved-data:/var/www/html/storage).

3. Once the container is running, you can access the Faved application in your web browser at http://localhost:8080. 

\* The first time you visit, you'll be prompted to set up the database. Just click "Initialize Database" to proceed and finish installation.
